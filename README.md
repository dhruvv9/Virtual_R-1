#  Virtual_R-1 product landing page using React + Vite and Tailwindcss
I have created a responsive landing page featuring a fully responsive navbar with a mobile drawer for displaying all the links. The site includes an appealing hero section that utilizes gradient text, lending a modern look to the design. Additionally, the webpage employs the video tag to showcase autoplaying and looping videos. This project is built to develop my skills .
